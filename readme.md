Requirements:
- terraform;
- azure cli;
- aws cli;

To run this Infrastructure as a Codem you should navigate to one of the folders(AWS and Azure).
After that you should apply the commands:
- terraform init (start a terraform project if you already haven't done this)
- terraform validate (to check if it's all ok)
- terraform fmt
- terraform plan
- terraform apply (it will appear to confirm and then it will be doing the deploy)
